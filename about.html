            <p>Hey man, I'm Tender Conflict. My purpose in this world is to make art, music, and to make people happy. <br><br>
                I live for nothing more than to help the people I meet irl and online. Music has always been a passion of mine, 
                 I had always played piano when I was younger but I never composed anything until I started using Reaper on my
                  laptop with some video game soundfonts downloaded. It was December of 2021 in college. I figured with another
                   suicide date set I might as well try making something creative. Even with crappy small songs I made, 
                   The fulfilment it gave me kept me going. I want to make something better, and better, and better and better 
                   and better. I never want to stop creating art and music. No matter what it takes. 
<br><br>
Some time after moving back into my parent's house I was able to come up with a song that I was finally proud of called "Drills".
 I spent some time after that coming up with a name, It took a few days but I ended up with the name Tender Conflict and was happy
  with it and how it looked. I eventually made more and then created my first album during that summer of 2022.
 <br><br>
 I hope I can keep continuing to make music that makes you smile, and art that makes you smile.
  Im currently working on my own little indie game, and I have been blessed by God to compose 
  music for a great platforming indie game. I strive to try my hardest to make something with soul, something meaningful. 
 <br><br>
 With the support of my friends, my wonderful mother, my beautiful Wife, and you I have been 
 able to keep on going and bring more music into this world. 

 Ps: Trans rights forever
 <br><br><br><br>
 Some fun stuff: <br>
 
 ★ Im a big Toronto Maple Leafs Fan and a nerd who cosplays.<br> ☆ I love the bands Ween and the Scary Jokes. <br>
 ★ I love me some bold rock cider. nothin better than the bold<br>
 ☆ I love making jokes and ppl smile. <br>
 ★ I probably spend too much time on the computer hahaha.</p>
