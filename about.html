            <p>Tender conflict is a solo project by me.
                 This is my outlet for expressing myself through music.
                 My inspirations are different feelings and
                  experiences in my personal life. <br><br>
                I started this project when living at my grandparent's house. 
            I had always played piano when I was younger but I never composed
        anything until I started using Reaper on my laptop with some video game soundfonts downloaded. 
        During this time I was going through hell, music was a way to endure it.
        <br><br>
    Some time after moving back into my parent's house I was able to come up with a song that I was finally proud of
called "Drills". I eventually made more and then created my first album during that summer of 2022.
<br><br>
With the support of my friends, especially those in Ontario, my mother, and my love, I have been able to keep on going and 
bring more music into this world.
<br><br>
Some fun stuff: Im a big Toronto Maple Leafs Fan and a nerd who cosplays. I love the bands Ween and the Scary Jokes.
